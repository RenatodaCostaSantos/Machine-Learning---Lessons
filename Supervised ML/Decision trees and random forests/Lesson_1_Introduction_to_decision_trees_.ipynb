        "# Foundations of decision trees\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees are another type of supervised machine learning. Some of its advantages are that it is easier to visualize than other algorithms and convenient to present the results to a non-technical audience. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this course, we will use the sklearn library from python, which uses the classification and regression trees (CART) algorithm. Classification refers to predicting categorical outcomes (binary or multi-class), while the word regression refers to numerical outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we will focus on building a simplified version of regression and classification trees from scratch using a small dataset. It will help us understand the algorithms and appreciate the work done by the sklearn library.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Breaking down a decision tree\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose we want to answer the following question:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can your son enter the stadium to watch a soccer game?\n",
        "\n",
        "We need to answer a couple of other questions before answering this one. Typing each of them would be overwhelming. Decision trees provide an easy and convenient way to visualize the path to the final answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "![decision tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RenatodaCostaSantos/Machine-Learning---Lessons/main/Supervised%20ML/Decision%20trees%20and%20random%20forests/images/decision_tree.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The brown boxes in the figure above are called **nodes**, and they always contain a threshold used to split the data into two groups depending if the answer evaluates to True or False. The green ones are called **leaves**. The leaves are nodes that do not perform any splits on the data. In other words, that's where the algorithm terminates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The nodes between the root and the leaf nodes are called **internal nodes**. They always have a node above them and always perform a split. The number of internal nodes depends on the complexity of the data provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to answer the question proposed at the beginning of this lesson, we generated a decision with three **levels**. It contains one root node, two internal, and four leaf nodes. It is much easier to visualize the steps followed to find the final answer than to write down all the questions involved in this procedure.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Nodes classification\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a classification devoted only to the nodes of a decision tree. A node divided into two subsequent nodes is called a **parent node**. The nodes generated by a parent node are called **child nodes**. This classification infers:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The root node is not derived from any other node, making it an exclusive parent node.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Internal nodes are both parent and child nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The leaves are exclusively child nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Branches\n",
        "\n",
        "The arrows in a decision tree are called **branches**. The ones to the left are branches generated when the threshold evaluates True, while the ones to the right are generated when it evaluates False. The figure below breaks down the first image of this lesson making explicitly the nomenclature we just introduced:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Thresholds\n",
        "\n",
        "As we saw in the figure above, thresholds work as if statement in a dataset, splitting the data that satisfies a condition from the rest. \n",
